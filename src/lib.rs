//! A Rust port of the Monte-Carlo particle transport proxy-app [Quicksilver][1].
//!
//! Fastiron mimics Monte-Carlo particle transport code to study their behavior on
//! various hardware architectures. The aim of this port is to evaluate Rust's
//! capabilities and performances in the context of parallel programming and
//! scaling problem size.
//!
